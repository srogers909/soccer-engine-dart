## Code Standards

### Dart Style Guide

We follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) with these specific requirements:

#### Naming Conventions

```dart
// Classes: PascalCase
class PlayerTransfer { }

// Variables and functions: camelCase
final String playerName = 'Messi';
void calculateRating() { }

// Constants: camelCase with const
const int maxPlayers = 25;

// Enums: PascalCase with camelCase values
enum PlayerPosition {
  goalkeeper,
  defender,
  midfielder,
  forward,
}

// Files: snake_case
// player_transfer.dart
// match_simulator.dart
```

#### Code Organization

```dart
// Import order: dart, flutter, packages, relative
import 'dart:math';

import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

import '../models/player.dart';
import 'team.dart';
```

#### Documentation

```dart
/// Brief description of the class or function.
/// 
/// Longer description if needed, explaining the purpose,
/// usage patterns, and important considerations.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final player = Player(
///   id: 'player_001',
///   name: 'Lionel Messi',
///   position: PlayerPosition.forward,
/// );
/// ```
class Player {
  /// The unique identifier for this player.
  final String id;
  
  /// The player's display name.
  final String name;
}
```

### Architecture Patterns

#### Immutable Data Models

```dart
@JsonSerializable()
class Player extends Equatable {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  
  const Player({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
  });
  
  /// Creates a copy with updated values
  Player copyWith({
    String? id,
    String? name,
  }) {
    return Player(
      id: id ?? this.id,
      name: name ?? this.name,
    );
  }
  
  @override
  List<Object> get props => [id];
}
```

#### Validation Patterns

```dart
class Player {
  factory Player({
    required String id,
    required String name,
    required int rating,
  }) {
    if (id.isEmpty) {
      throw ArgumentError('Player ID cannot be empty');
    }
    if (name.isEmpty) {
      throw ArgumentError('Player name cannot be empty');
    }
    if (rating < 1 || rating > 100) {
      throw ArgumentError('Player rating must be between 1 and 100');
    }
    
    return Player._internal(
      id: id,
      name: name,
      rating: rating,
    );
  }
  
  const Player._internal({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.rating,
  });
}
```

#### Error Handling

```dart
// Use specific exception types
class InvalidPlayerRatingException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  const InvalidPlayerRatingException(this.message);
  
  @override
  String toString() => 'InvalidPlayerRatingException: $message';
}

// Handle errors gracefully
Result<Player> createPlayer(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
  try {
    return Result.success(Player.fromJson(data));
  } on FormatException catch (e) {
    return Result.failure('Invalid player data format: $e');
  } on ArgumentError catch (e) {
    return Result.failure('Invalid player arguments: $e');
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

We maintain **100% test coverage**. Every contribution must include comprehensive tests.

#### Required Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Property-Based Tests**: Test with random inputs
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions

#### Test Structure

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:soccer_engine/soccer_engine.dart';

void main() {
  group('Player', () {
    group('constructor', () {
      test('creates player with valid data', () {
        final player = Player(
          id: 'player_001',
          name: 'Lionel Messi',
          position: PlayerPosition.forward,
          overallRating: 95,
        );
        
        expect(player.id, equals('player_001'));
        expect(player.name, equals('Lionel Messi'));
        expect(player.position, equals(PlayerPosition.forward));
        expect(player.overallRating, equals(95));
      });
      
      test('throws ArgumentError for empty id', () {
        expect(
          () => Player(
            id: '',
            name: 'Messi',
            position: PlayerPosition.forward,
            overallRating: 95,
          ),
          throwsA(isA<ArgumentError>()),
        );
      });
      
      test('throws ArgumentError for invalid rating', () {
        expect(
          () => Player(
            id: 'player_001',
            name: 'Messi',
            position: PlayerPosition.forward,
            overallRating: 101, // Invalid rating
          ),
          throwsA(isA<ArgumentError>()),
        );
      });
    });
    
    group('copyWith', () {
      test('creates copy with updated values', () {
        final original = Player(
          id: 'player_001',
          name: 'Messi',
          position: PlayerPosition.forward,
          overallRating: 95,
        );
        
        final updated = original.copyWith(overallRating: 96);
        
        expect(updated.id, equals(original.id));
        expect(updated.name, equals(original.name));
        expect(updated.position, equals(original.position));
        expect(updated.overallRating, equals(96));
      });
    });
    
    group('JSON serialization', () {
      test('serializes to JSON correctly', () {
        final player = Player(
          id: 'player_001',
          name: 'Messi',
          position: PlayerPosition.forward,
          overallRating: 95,
        );
        
        final json = player.toJson();
        
        expect(json['id'], equals('player_001'));
        expect(json['name'], equals('Messi'));
        expect(json['position'], equals('forward'));
        expect(json['overallRating'], equals(95));
      });
      
      test('deserializes from JSON correctly', () {
        final json = {
          'id': 'player_001',
          'name': 'Messi',
          'position': 'forward',
          'overallRating': 95,
        };
        
        final player = Player.fromJson(json);
        
        expect(player.id, equals('player_001'));
        expect(player.name, equals('Messi'));
        expect(player.position, equals(PlayerPosition.forward));
        expect(player.overallRating, equals(95));
      });
    });
  });
}
```

#### Property-Based Testing

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:soccer_engine/soccer_engine.dart';

void main() {
  group('Player property tests', () {
    test('rating is always within valid range', () {
      final random = Random(12345);
      
      for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        final rating = random.nextInt(100) + 1; // 1-100
        
        final player = Player(
          id: 'player_$i',
          name: 'Player $i',
          position: PlayerPosition.forward,
          overallRating: rating,
        );
        
        expect(player.overallRating, greaterThanOrEqualTo(1));
        expect(player.overallRating, lessThanOrEqualTo(100));
      }
    });
  });
}
```

### Running Tests

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

Every public API must be documented:

```dart
/// Calculates the overall team rating based on player ratings and chemistry.
/// 
/// The calculation considers:
/// - Average player ratings weighted by position importance
/// - Team chemistry factor (0.9-1.1 multiplier)
/// - Formation suitability bonus
/// 
/// Returns a rating between 1 and 100, where:
/// - 90-100: World-class team
/// - 80-89: Elite team
/// - 70-79: Strong team
/// - 60-69: Average team
/// - Below 60: Weak team
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final team = Team(players: players, formation: Formation.f442);
/// final rating = team.calculateOverallRating();
/// print('Team rating: $rating');
/// ```
/// 
/// Throws [StateError] if the team has fewer than 11 players.
int calculateOverallRating() {
  // Implementation...
}
```
